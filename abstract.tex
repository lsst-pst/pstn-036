We describe the receipt of the LSST Camera on the summit of Cerro Pachon in Chile and the subsequent reverification of the camera. We then describe the installation and initial commissioning of the camera on the telescope. Finally, we describe initial instrument signature signal characterization, calibration and removal from early commisioning data.
